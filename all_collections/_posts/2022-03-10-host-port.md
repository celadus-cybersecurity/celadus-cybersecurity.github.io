## Host Discovery

#### Explaining the below script

- From 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.254  ping each address with timeout 200 milliseconds and print it if is up

```powershell
1..254 | ForEach-Object {Get-WmiObject Win32_PingStatus -Filter "Address='10.0.2.$_' and Timeout=200 and ResolveAddressNames='true' and StatusCode=0" | select ProtocolAddress*}
```

## Port Scan

- I will scan the `10.0.2.15`

#### Explaining the below script

- Check if the ip `10.0.2.15` is online and after that for each port from the `ports` list 
  try to make a tcp client connection. If the socket is null then the port is closed else is open

```powershell
$ips = ("10.0.2.15");
$ports = (21, 22, 80, 443);

foreach ($ip in $ips) {

    if (Test-Connection -BufferSize 32 -Count 1 -ComputerName $ip -Quiet) {
        Write-Host "[+] The "$ip" is Online"
        Write-Host "[!] Port Scan starting ..."
        foreach ($port in $ports) {
            try {

                $socket = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient($ip, $port);

            }
            catch {

            };

            if ($socket -eq $null) {
                Write-Host $ip":"$port" - Closed";

            }
            else {

               Write-Host $ip":"$port" - Open";
               $socket = $null;
            }
        }
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "[-] The "$ip" is Down"
    }
}
```
